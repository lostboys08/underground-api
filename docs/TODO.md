# A note to keep track of what I still need to do

## First
- Make the admin/contact-submit endpoint actually save the contact details somewhere (email to us, save to db, call CRM api)


- Add contact, location (from the format location logic we have for sending emails), response data, maybe more... !! Once this is complete, add integration task to frontend TODO
- Notification table and logic
- Reports logic (frontend app)
