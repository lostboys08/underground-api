# A note to keep track of what I still need to do

- Make /tickets/update endpoint accept company_id and ticket_number instead of username and password
- Add contact, location (from the format location logic we have for sending emails), response data, maybe more... !! Once this is complete, add integration task to frontend TODO
- Notification table and logic
- Reports logic (frontend app)
