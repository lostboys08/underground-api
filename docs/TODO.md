# A note to keep track of what I still need to do

## First
- Make the admin/contact-submit endpoint actually save the contact details somewhere (email to us, save to db, call CRM api) This was working, need to figure out why its not working (I think its expecting different data from the client server api call)


- Notification table and logic
- Reports logic (frontend app)
